Quadruple Witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

Despite the potential turbulence, some investors seize the opportunity to profit from the heightened activity.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, SPY maintains its support above the critical level of 441.06.

When it comes to Azure, Microsoft is facing the same dilemma because Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\"\u003eAMZN\u003c/a\u003e) has a much bigger representative on this front, Amazon Web Services. Amazon also launched its own platform that allows building and scaling generative AI services, Bedrock. Therefore, AI advancements are merely helping Microsoft keep up with Google and Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;But Adobe doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any worth opponents when it comes to its Creative Cloud and Firefly offerings. When it comes to AI, Adobe is doing an extraordinary job it was already doing with its initial services that are unique to the market. Unlike its rivals, Adobe is using AI to further differentiate itself by using this technology to upgrade its data, scale, talent and portfolio.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

By identifying a noisy segment in the speech, the user can crop it and instruct the model to regenerate the segment, much like using image-editing software to enhance photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike existing TTS generators, Voicebox doesn\u0026#8217;t require extensive source material to mimic a subject.

Its CDNA architecture is designed for large language models that use lots of memory as well as other cutting-edge AI models. AMD did not disclose any pricing details but lower pricing will not only put a price pressure on Nvidia whose\u0026nbsp;H100 comes at\u0026nbsp;$30,000 or more, but also have a deep impact on the development of generative AI applications that are high in cost.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eThe AI Opportunity And Untapped Market\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the PC market struggles to get out of its post-pandemic slump,\u0026nbsp;CEO Lisa Su\u0026nbsp;finds AI to be AMD\u0026rsquo;s largest and by far the biggest strategic long-term growth opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Analysts, AMD is certainly one of the greatest challenges to Nvidia especially with this new release that AMD will sell to everybody, but the key of its success remains lies in how many developers will want to use it. For example, AI developers preferred Nvidia chips due to a well-developed software package CUDA that enabled them to access the chip\u0026rsquo;s core hardware features. But AMD\u0026nbsp;revealed on Tuesday it made its own software for its AI chips, ROCm.\u0026nbsp;If developers embrace AMD\u0026rsquo;s chips, named by the company as accelerators, as a substitute for those made by Nvidia, the AI chip market is certainly in for a power shift and AMD is in for a turnaround as its current brand identity is tied to traditional computer processors. Reuters reported that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\"\u003eAMZN\u003c/a\u003e) is considering AMD\u0026rsquo;s chips but still hasn\u0026rsquo;t decided which chips will power its AI efforts, however Amazon has not made any public commitments.\u0026nbsp;Dave Brown, vice president of elastic compute cloud at Amazon,\u0026nbsp;did state that AMD and AWS teams are working together, while Amazon declined to work with Nvidia on the\u0026nbsp;DGX Cloud offering. But, it is common knowledge that Amazon, more precisely AWS, likes to design its serves from the ground up. For example, when it started selling H100 chips that Nvidia makes, it did it as part of its design.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eIntel Is The Living Proof That Future Is Promised To No One\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOn Friday, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\"\u003eINTC\u003c/a\u003e) revealed\u0026nbsp;it will be commiting\u0026nbsp;$4.6 billion in its new chip assembly and test facility in Poland as part of its plan to build capacity across three continents and restore its chip making leadership position. Last year, Intel announced it will be building a massive chip complex in Germany, as well as facilities in Ireland and France. Intel also announced yesterday that after 15 years, it is rebranding its consumer CPU. With a simplified naming scheme that focuses on its Core branding, many have noticed the new looks somewhat similar to AMD\u0026rsquo;s Ryzen naming scheme. After being the unquestioned leader with an almost market monopoly for over a decade, Intel is no longer fighting only against AMD who was its chief rival but also with Nvidia who took absolute charge because it was the first to enter the AI game and it did it early.

GPUs are undoubtedly powering the AI race, as these chips are used by OpenAI that built ChatGPT which seems to have started all the hype and certainly brought in a lot of good vibes to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ\"\u003eMSFT\u003c/a\u003e).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eThe\u0026nbsp;MI300X\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTargeted as a competitor to H100 GPU from Nvidia,\u0026nbsp;AMD\u0026rsquo;s forthcoming most-advanced GPU for artificial intelligence applications is expected to arrive to customers later this year. Its CDNA architecture is designed for large language models that use lots of memory as well as other cutting-edge AI models. AMD did not disclose any pricing details but lower pricing will not only put a price pressure on Nvidia whose\u0026nbsp;H100 comes at\u0026nbsp;$30,000 or more, but also have a deep impact on the development of generative AI applications that are high in cost.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eThe AI Opportunity And Untapped Market\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the PC market struggles to get out of its post-pandemic slump,\u0026nbsp;CEO Lisa Su\u0026nbsp;finds AI to be AMD\u0026rsquo;s largest and by far the biggest strategic long-term growth opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Analysts, AMD is certainly one of the greatest challenges to Nvidia especially with this new release that AMD will sell to everybody, but the key of its success remains lies in how many developers will want to use it. For example, AI developers preferred Nvidia chips due to a well-developed software package CUDA that enabled them to access the chip\u0026rsquo;s core hardware features. But AMD\u0026nbsp;revealed on Tuesday it made its own software for its AI chips, ROCm.\u0026nbsp;If developers embrace AMD\u0026rsquo;s chips, named by the company as accelerators, as a substitute for those made by Nvidia, the AI chip market is certainly in for a power shift and AMD is in for a turnaround as its current brand identity is tied to traditional computer processors. Reuters reported that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\"\u003eAMZN\u003c/a\u003e) is considering AMD\u0026rsquo;s chips but still hasn\u0026rsquo;t decided which chips will power its AI efforts, however Amazon has not made any public commitments.\u0026nbsp;Dave Brown, vice president of elastic compute cloud at Amazon,\u0026nbsp;did state that AMD and AWS teams are working together, while Amazon declined to work with Nvidia on the\u0026nbsp;DGX Cloud offering. But, it is common knowledge that Amazon, more precisely AWS, likes to design its serves from the ground up. For example, when it started selling H100 chips that Nvidia makes, it did it as part of its design.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eIntel Is The Living Proof That Future Is Promised To No One\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOn Friday, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\"\u003eINTC\u003c/a\u003e) revealed\u0026nbsp;it will be commiting\u0026nbsp;$4.6 billion in its new chip assembly and test facility in Poland as part of its plan to build capacity across three continents and restore its chip making leadership position. Last year, Intel announced it will be building a massive chip complex in Germany, as well as facilities in Ireland and France. Intel also announced yesterday that after 15 years, it is rebranding its consumer CPU. With a simplified naming scheme that focuses on its Core branding, many have noticed the new looks somewhat similar to AMD\u0026rsquo;s Ryzen naming scheme. After being the unquestioned leader with an almost market monopoly for over a decade, Intel is no longer fighting only against AMD who was its chief rival but also with Nvidia who took absolute charge because it was the first to enter the AI game and it did it early.

As I stated last week, I like to chart using ES rather than SPY or SPX because ES runs 23 hours a day, 5 days a week, and that will lead to a lot less gaps and give some key overnight levels from overseas trading. Last week was another strong one, creating another bullish imbalance in the process. I will view that area from 4297 to 4348 as support moving forward. Price did make its way into a bearish imbalance, which ranges from 4449 to 4572. While these are large ranges, I believe having higher time frame levels can help set a bias going into a new week.

As I stated last week, I like to chart using ES rather than SPY or SPX because ES runs 23 hours a day, 5 days a week, and that will lead to a lot less gaps and give some key overnight levels from overseas trading. Last week was another strong one, creating another bullish imbalance in the process. I will view that area from 4297 to 4348 as support moving forward. Price did make its way into a bearish imbalance, which ranges from 4449 to 4572. While these are large ranges, I believe having higher time frame levels can help set a bias going into a new week. I\u0026#39;d like to see the market pullback into the newly formed bullish imbalance I referred to above, and reprice higher from there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://public-files.gumroad.com/330mze07o4zc1pshfh5f0rv2hdgc\" style=\"height:371px; width:624px\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eES Daily - Bullish imbalance formed on the daily Friday, from 4439 to 4451.

(NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AVGO#NASDAQ\"\u003eAVGO\u003c/a\u003e) increased by 35.09% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Broadcom has. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBroadcom Debt\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Broadcom's most recent financial statement as reported on June 7, 2023, total debt is at $39.31 billion, with $38.19 billion in long-term debt and $1.12 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $11.55 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $27.76 billion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. \u003cstrong\u003eCurrent debt\u003c/strong\u003e is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while \u003cstrong\u003elong-term debt\u003c/strong\u003e is the portion due in more than 1 year. \u003cstrong\u003eCash equivalents\u003c/strong\u003e includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. \u003cstrong\u003eTotal debt\u003c/strong\u003e equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Broadcom has $71.67 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.55. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, but normal for another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1687361451_0.png\" alt=\"debt_fig\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Debt Is Important\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

(NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\"\u003eAAPL\u003c/a\u003e) moved higher by 17.86% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Apple has. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eApple Debt\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Apple's most recent balance sheet as reported on May 5, 2023, total debt is at $109.61 billion, with $97.04 billion in long-term debt and $12.57 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $24.69 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $84.93 billion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. \u003cstrong\u003eCurrent debt\u003c/strong\u003e is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while \u003cstrong\u003elong-term debt\u003c/strong\u003e is the portion due in more than 1 year. \u003cstrong\u003eCash equivalents\u003c/strong\u003e includes cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. \u003cstrong\u003eTotal debt\u003c/strong\u003e equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Apple has $332.16 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.33. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, but average for another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1687445119_0.png\" alt=\"debt_fig\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Shareholders Look At Debt?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

The results of this year's study are based on responses from 93,380 purchasers and lessees of new 2023 model-year vehicles who were surveyed early in their ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://insideevs.com/tesla/\"\u003eTesla\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://insideevs.com/rivian/\"\u003eRivian\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://insideevs.com/lucid/\"\u003eLucid\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://insideevs.com/polestar/\"\u003ePolestar\u003c/a\u003e have ranked at the bottom spots of the chart, with the worst score going to Lucid Motors, which got a result of 340 problems per 100 vehicles (PP100).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe whole EV manufacturer picture is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTesla Motors: 257 PP100\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRivian Motors: 282 PP100\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePolestar: 313 PP100\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLucid Motors: 340 PP100\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eTesla saw an increase of 31 PP100 year over year, while Polestar improved 15 PP100. At the same time, Rivian and Lucid Motors were both included in this year's study for the first time. However, J.D. Power notes that all four carmakers are not officially ranked amongst other brands in the study as they do not meet ranking criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data analytics company says that, unlike other car manufacturers, Tesla, Rivian, Polestar, and Lucid do not grant it permission to survey its owners in states where authorization is required.

Power notes that all new vehicles are becoming more problematic, with 12 problems per 100 vehicles more this year than in 2022 and 30 more PP100 compared to 2021.

With performance like this, long-term shareholders are optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1687451463_0.png\" alt=\"Past Year Chart\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEvaluating Apple P/E in Comparison to Its Peers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S\u0026amp;P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the \u003cstrong\u003e75.12\u003c/strong\u003e in the Technology Hardware, Storage \u0026amp; Peripherals industry, Apple Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of \u003cstrong\u003e31.36\u003c/strong\u003e. Shareholders might be inclined to think that  the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.benzinga.com/files/images/story/2023/1687451464_1.png\" alt=\"Guage\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. \u003c/p\u003e","symbols":["AAPL"],"source":"benzinga"}]

While this approach increases the complexity of the manufacturing process, it also reduces development times and costs because most advanced manufacturing technology isn\u0026rsquo;t wasted on tiles that are not able to benefit from it as these are sorted to cheaper and older ways of doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eIt\u0026#39;s AI Time\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWith the tile-based architecture, Intel is bringing AI with Meteor Lake chips that will come with a dedicated AI processor, named the VPU. Although running a ChatGPT-like program on a PC won\u0026rsquo;t be possible anytime soon due to the complex requirements, plenty of AI tasks could potentially come to our simplified devices. Moreover, dedicated AI hardware will allow Intel to free up the CPU and GPU, and this could result in improved speed that users tend to appreciate.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eIf Intel Pulls It All Off, Many Rewards Are On The Way\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eCollectively, all the above changes have the potential to\u0026nbsp;help Intel cement its lead in the PC CPU market.\u0026nbsp;Intel is going all in by risking with a new manufacturing process, a new architectural structure, and a new type of AI processor, and it is doing it all at the same time. But if it makes it work, these moves will pay off in a big way. However, AMD will certainly not be standing still with its shares skyrocketing 92% year-to-date as it geared up its AI chips game to catch up to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\"\u003eNVDA\u003c/a\u003e) whose shares as much as tripled this year.
