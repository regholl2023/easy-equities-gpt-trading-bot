Quadruple Witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. These dates, particularly the last trading hour, often see increased market activity and volatility as traders adjust their expiring positions. Despite the potential turbulence, some investors seize the opportunity to profit from the heightened activity.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, SPY maintains its support above the critical level of 441.06.

By\u0026nbsp;launching\u0026nbsp;a generative AI platform for the Creative Cloud,\u0026nbsp;Firefly,\u0026nbsp;Adobe\u0026rsquo;s users are able\u0026nbsp;to create images, videos, and digital models\u0026nbsp;by using\u0026nbsp;text-based prompts\u0026nbsp;which is as simple as this process can get.\u0026nbsp;Although it already dominates the market for digital media editing software,\u0026nbsp;Firefly could represent a massive upgrade.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch3\u003eAdobe Vs Microsoft On The AI front\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBesides both being considered as blue chips in tech, what Adobe and Microsoft have in common is that they both underwent massive cloud transformation and they are both well positioned as the generative AI market continues to grow.\u0026nbsp;Although generative AI efforts aren\u0026#39;t meaningfully boosting\u0026nbsp;their\u0026nbsp;revenues yet,\u0026nbsp;their long-term potential on this front is attracting significant attention.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut the key difference between the two is the competition they face. With ChatGPT upgrade for Bing, Microsoft arguably gained less because Bing is still a far cry from leading the search market that is absolutely dominated by Alphabet\u0026#39;s Google, who launched its generative AI response to Microsoft, Bard. When it comes to Azure, Microsoft is facing the same dilemma because Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:\u003ca class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ\"\u003eAMZN\u003c/a\u003e) has a much bigger representative on this front, Amazon Web Services. Amazon also launched its own platform that allows building and scaling generative AI services, Bedrock. Therefore, AI advancements are merely helping Microsoft keep up with Google and Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;But Adobe doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any worth opponents when it comes to its Creative Cloud and Firefly offerings. When it comes to AI, Adobe is doing an extraordinary job it was already doing with its initial services that are unique to the market. Unlike its rivals, Adobe is using AI to further differentiate itself by using this technology to upgrade its data, scale, talent and portfolio.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

By identifying a noisy segment in the speech, the user can crop it and instruct the model to regenerate the segment, much like using image-editing software to enhance photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike existing TTS generators, Voicebox doesn\u0026#8217;t require extensive source material to mimic a subject.
